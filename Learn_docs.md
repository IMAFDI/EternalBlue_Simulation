# Learn Docs: EternalBlue and Its History

## Introduction

**EternalBlue** is one of the most infamous exploits in cybersecurity history. It was a vulnerability in the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, specifically SMBv1, which is a file-sharing protocol in Windows. The exploit took advantage of a weakness in Microsoft's implementation of SMBv1, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. 

This document provides an overview of EternalBlue, its history, and its impact, especially in relation to the WannaCry ransomware attack.

## History of EternalBlue

EternalBlue was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) as part of a suite of cyberweapons. In April 2017, the hacking group known as the **Shadow Brokers** leaked EternalBlue along with other NSA exploits. This leak exposed one of the most potent vulnerabilities that could be used against unpatched Windows systems, causing significant concern among cybersecurity experts.

### Timeline of Key Events:
- **2009**: Microsoft implements SMBv1 in its Windows operating system.
- **2011-2012**: The NSA allegedly develops EternalBlue, targeting the SMBv1 vulnerability.
- **March 14, 2017**: Microsoft releases a security patch (MS17-010) to address the SMBv1 vulnerability.
- **April 14, 2017**: The Shadow Brokers release the EternalBlue exploit to the public.
- **May 12, 2017**: The WannaCry ransomware attack begins, leveraging EternalBlue to spread across unpatched systems worldwide.

## WannaCry Ransomware Attack

EternalBlue gained global attention during the **WannaCry ransomware attack** in May 2017. WannaCry was a type of malware that encrypted files on infected computers, demanding a ransom in Bitcoin to decrypt the files. 

### How WannaCry Worked:
- WannaCry used the EternalBlue exploit to propagate across networks. It exploited SMBv1 to infect machines and spread rapidly, especially within corporate networks.
- The attack affected over 200,000 computers across 150 countries within a few days.
- Major organizations such as the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), FedEx, and Telefónica were severely impacted.

### Impact of WannaCry:
- Many organizations faced downtime, financial losses, and reputational damage.
- Critical services, including healthcare and logistics, were disrupted, highlighting the importance of cybersecurity in infrastructure.

## Microsoft Patch (MS17-010)

Fortunately, Microsoft had released a patch two months prior to the WannaCry attack, in **March 2017** (MS17-010). This patch addressed the SMBv1 vulnerability by fixing the flaw that EternalBlue exploited. However, many systems remained unpatched at the time of the WannaCry outbreak, which enabled the widespread attack.

### The Importance of System Updates:
The EternalBlue exploit and WannaCry attack underscored the critical need for timely system updates and patch management. Organizations that applied the MS17-010 patch were protected from the attack, whereas those that did not faced devastating consequences.

## Legacy and Modern Exploits

While Microsoft has since deprecated SMBv1, and many organizations have patched their systems, EternalBlue's legacy continues. Variants of the exploit have been used in subsequent malware campaigns, such as **NotPetya** and **Emotet**. These attacks serve as a reminder of how powerful cyberweapons can be and why maintaining strong cybersecurity defenses is vital.

### EternalBlue's Continued Use:
- **NotPetya (June 2017)**: A destructive malware attack similar to WannaCry, using EternalBlue to propagate.
- **Emotet Malware (2018)**: Emotet, a sophisticated banking Trojan, incorporated EternalBlue to spread across networks.

## Lessons Learned

The EternalBlue exploit and subsequent attacks offer several lessons:
1. **Importance of Patching**: Always keep systems up to date with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.
2. **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical systems from the broader network to reduce the impact of exploits.
3. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Ensure that critical data is regularly backed up to minimize the damage from ransomware and other attacks.
4. **Ethical Cybersecurity Practices**: Knowledge of exploits and vulnerabilities should be used for defensive purposes and to strengthen security measures.

## Conclusion

EternalBlue remains a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist in legacy systems and the devastating impact of cyberweapons falling into the wrong hands. The EternalBlue Simulation Project aims to educate users about such vulnerabilities and promote ethical cybersecurity practices.

By learning from the past and continuously improving security measures, we can protect systems from future exploits and reduce the risk of widespread cyberattacks.
